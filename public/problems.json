        "description": "Imagine a scenario involving a salesperson who needs to visit five distinct cities to promote their products. These cities are uniquely numbered from 1 to 5. The objective for the salesperson is to undertake a journey starting from any one of these cities and cover all others once before returning to the starting point, all while incurring the least travel cost possible. The travel costs vary depending on the route between each city pair.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the travel costs between the cities:\n- The cost to travel from City 1 to City 2 is 73 units, to City 3 is 39 units, to City 4 is 79 units, and to City 5 is 38 units.\n- From City 2, it costs 73 units to reach City 1, 30 units to go to City 3, 46 units to visit City 4, and 29 units to get to City 5.\n- Traveling from City 3, the costs are 39 units to City 1, 30 units to City 2, 88 units to City 4, and 57 units to City 5.\n- From City 4, it costs 79 units to go to City 1, 46 units to City 2, 88 units to City 3, and 59 units to City 5.\n- Lastly, from City 5, the travel costs are 38 units to City 1, 29 units to City 2, 57 units to City 3, and 59 units to City 4.\n\nGiven these details, what is the minimum total travel cost for the salesperson to visit each city exactly once and return to the starting city?"

        "description": "SupplyLink, a major supplier, is looking to optimize its distribution network to ensure the efficient supply of goods to its five retail stores from a selection of five potential distribution centers. Each distribution center incurs an initial opening cost and has a limit on how much it can supply. The transportation cost of goods from these centers to the retail stores also varies. The goal is to meet the demand at each retail store at minimal total cost, which includes the opening costs of distribution centers and the transportation cost of the goods.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 5\n- Number of Retail Stores Needing Supply: 5\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: 151,000\n- Center 2: 192,000\n- Center 3: 114,000\n- Center 4: 171,000\n- Center 5: 160,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1: $5 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5\n- From Center 2: $5 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5\n- From Center 3: $4 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5\n- From Center 4: $4 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5\n- From Center 5: $1 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $2 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 589\n- Store 2: 962\n- Store 3: 966\n- Store 4: 643\n- Store 5: 904\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1954\n- Center 2: 1446\n- Center 3: 820\n- Center 4: 1640\n- Center 5: 966\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the minimum total cost that SupplyLink will incur to open distribution centers and transport goods in order to satisfy all retail stores' demands? This total cost includes both the opening costs of the centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores."

        "description": "There are four nodes connected by directed edges. Node 1, which could represent the starting point, is connected to two other nodes: There is an edge from node 1 to node 2 with a capacity of 8. There is an edge from node 1 to node 3 with a capacity of 7. Node 2 is situated at the top of the graph and acts as an intermediate node, with three edges connected to it: An edge leading from node 2 to node 3 with a capacity of 2. An edge leading from node 2 to node 4 with a capacity of 4. Node 3 is another intermediate node and has two edges: An edge from node 3 to node 4 with a substantial capacity of 12. Node 4, which could represent the target or terminal, does not have any edges leading to other nodes, implying that it could be the end point. Find the corresponding maximum flow of the graph. Provide your answer rounded to the nearest integar."
